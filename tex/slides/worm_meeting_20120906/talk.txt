- I'll be describing our efforts to answer the
question: In the C. elegans embryo, which genes
are expressed in which cell?

Not that we'll necessarily answer that question.
But first, why do we care?

Sometimes, a gene is expressed in, and functions
in, a particular tissue. For instance, pha-4 is
expressed in the pharynx, as well as the pharyngeal
valve cell, and 


Furthermore, where many genes are expressed is
important.


For instance, in the C lineage, 






Splicing


What features of the transcriptome might differ
between tissues, besides "how much a gene is
expressed?"

Different splice forms are expressed in different
tissues. For instance, this gene has one splice
form enriched in 

Furthermore, since we're using strand-specific
sequencing, we can see whether the sense or antisense
strand is being expressed. In some 



We haven't done very much quantification of such
splicing and antisense, but we're hoping to do that.


Besides seeing what genes are enriched in individual
sort fractions, we can also see what genes are
enriched in groups of sort fractions. To do this,
we used hierarchical clustering, which groups
similar samples and genes together. 










Whither unmixing?

We have been trying to find the difference between
theory and practice here. One difference is that
some cells are being lost. Possibly a bigger problem
is that the gating in the sorting, and the data from
imaging, isn't perfectly matched.

We're sequencing the negatives now, which besides
increasing our dynamic range, also may help with
the unmixing.
