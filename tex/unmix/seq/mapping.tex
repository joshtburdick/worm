We used {\tt tophat} to map reads to release WS220 (ce10) of the {\em C. elegans} genome.



\section*{Ribosomal reads}

Although we depleted ribosomal RNA from the sequenced samples, reads from such RNAs nonetheless
leaked through. Ribosomal genes are present in many copies in the genome, but are placed on
the end of chromosome I: we considered reads mapping after 15,058,993-15,065,751 to be ribosomal.
