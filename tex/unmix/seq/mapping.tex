We used Tophat, version 2.0.2, to map reads to the {\tt ce6} release of the {\em C. elegans} genome.

\subsection*{Quantification}

We used the {\tt coverageBed} utility from bedtools to count reads in a given region,
only including uniquely-mapping reads, and measured a gene's expression in units of
reads per million.


\section*{Ribosomal reads}

Although we depleted ribosomal RNA from the sequenced samples, reads from such RNAs nonetheless
leaked through. Ribosomal genes are present in many copies in the genome, but are placed on
the end of chromosome I: we considered reads mapping after 15,058,993-15,065,751 to be ribosomal.



\section*{Antisense transcription}

We also quantified reads within each genes' bounds, but on the opposite strand.
