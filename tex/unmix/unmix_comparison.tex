\subsection*{Comparison of unmixing methods}

Some of the assumptions we are making may be incorrect. In order to gauge
which are correct, we




\subsubsection*{Correcting for sort purity}

We either 



\subsubsection*{Including negative fractions}

We either included, or didn't include, 



\subsubsection*{Cell volume}

Cells which are larger contribute more RNA to a given sample.
We would expect predictions which incorporate this to be more accurate
(unless our cell volume estimates are incorrect.)

Predictions {\bf without} including cell volume weighted each cell equally.
Predictions {\bf with} cell volume weighted cells based on branch length.



\subsubsection*{Measurement uncertainty}







\subsection*{Results}

To measure accuracy, we compared the fourteen reporter patterns
with predictions made using the remaining thirteen reporters.
We measured Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation,
and area-under-the-curve.
