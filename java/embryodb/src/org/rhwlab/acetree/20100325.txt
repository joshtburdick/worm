Maybe give some more attention to this.

I would like to know how much of the source distribution is really needed.

It would be interesting to see what Anthony did about comparing the new
approach with the traditional SN.

It might be good to get John's input on this issue.

I was thinking of running 102405_pha4red thru the new code since it is the
most heavily edited series we have and claims to be edited to 462 cells.

I have not heard from Brian McNally but I would like his input so I can try
this out on the cluster.

I should also make a preliminary survey of how the code could be converted to
java. Presumably if I volunteered, Anthony would be willing to consult.
