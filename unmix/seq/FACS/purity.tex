\subsection*{Cells lost by FACS sorting}

If we are trying to estimate expression in FACS-sorted
cells, then it is important to deterimine if the sorting
process is losing any cells. If it is, then ideally
we would like to know which cells are lost, and/or
correct for which cells are lost.

\subsection*{Comparison of ungated and singlet samples}

To try to determine this,
we sequenced {\em ungated} cells, which were dissociated
from embryos, but weren't FACS sorted. We also sequenced
{\em singlets} -- cells that went through the cell sorter,
but weren't gated by fluorescence. We ran these controls
with both the {\em cnd-1} and {\em pha-4} samples.

More genes enriched in ungated samples compared to singlets,
than the other way around. The enrichment was generally similar
between the {\em cnd-1} and {\em pha-4} samples.

\subsection*{Genes enriched in ungated, relative to singlets}

There were 150 genes enriched more than fourfold in the ungated samples,
relative to singlets.
The ten annotated genes with the highlest enrichment were:

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
gene & $\log_2$ fold enrichment in ungated & annotation from WormBase \\
\hline
cpz-1 & 3.3 & present in hypodermal cells (and adult gonad and pharynx) \\
cpr-6 & 3.1 &  \\
sepa-1 (M01E5.6) & 3.1 &   \\
ttr-50 & 3.1 &  \\
tag-10 & 3.0 & amphid neurons during 3-fold stage of embryogenesis \\
btb-11 & 2.9 &  \\
beta-mannosidase & 2.9 & localizes to lysozome \\
tbx-9 & 2.8 & expressed in E lineage and hypodermis \\
fbxc-18 & 2.8 &  \\
fbxb-3 & 2.8 & \\
\end{tabular}

The enrichment of {\em tbx-9}
and {\em cpz-1} suggests that the sorting process depletes hypodermal cells and
intestine. The lower {\em tag-10} expression may indicate that the sorting
doesn't include cells at the 3-fold stage of development.

\subsection*{Genes enriched in singlets, relative to ungated}

There were 25 genes enriched more than threefold in the singlet samples,
relative to the ungated samples. Here are those with known annotation:

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
gene & $\log_2$ fold enrichment in ungated & annotation from WormBase \\
\hline
hlh-15 & -1.8 & expressed in head and tail neurons \\
ceh-5 & -1.7 & expressed in head neurons \\
hot-6 & -1.7 &  \\
acc-4 & -1.6 & enriched in A-class motor neurons  \\
grl-18 & -1.6 & expressed in socket cells \\
nspc-7 & -1.6 &   \\
\end{tabular}

Several of these are expressed in neurons, which suggests that the
sorting process is including
neurons. This is somewhat contradicted by the enrichment of {\em tag-10}
(which is specific to amphid neurons)
in the ungated cells.
